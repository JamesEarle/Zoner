Virtual Reality vs. Augmented Reality, quite different

Tools of the trade?
	
	Occulus - VR device. Acquired by facebook for $2B

	Steam VR - HTC device. Used for major games, put out by Valve.

	Hololens - Augmented Reality (AR) not the same as the above. SDK $3000, but wireless

	Google Glass - AR Device, $1500, stopped in early 2015. 

	Google Cardboard - VR device, very cheap, using your phone. $20 for the rest of the device.

	Daqri and the smart helmet.


VR is about being set in a new reality.
AR is about adding to the users current reality.

Anaglyph style coding for VR is available in three.js (Red and Blue glasses)
	Cool and retro but not very efficient

Parallax barrier.
	You see an image from three perspectives (like the bill boards that change based where you're standing)
	No need for glasses
	also available in three.js

	Stereo Effect - three.js again, left eye and right eye (similar to crossing them)

	WebVR - Google and Mozilla. 

	Too many platforms to pick... don't want to focus on a single one, othewise you'll recode multiple times.

	WebVR Boilerplate codes once and focuses on the popular ones, nobody wants the exotic ones.

	Available on github.

AR is not as simple, working hard but it's not there yet 

	Needs are much more demanding.
		Video feed that is processed and 3D mapping is overlayed on top, then display both.

	To satisfy camera needs just use mobile phone (not on iOS)

	ARToolkit on GitHub open source library, from Daqri.

	Next Open Source to be released from them is the core, four.js 

	WebAR - Augmented Reality for the web, AR on top of three.js.

		Runs on Android!

	Can use markers as placeholders near devices, e.g. by fridge, or machiner in a shop to display live information about it.
